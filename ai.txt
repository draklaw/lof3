- A player will either follow a strat, play his favorite moves or experiment.
- Strats are conditional actions, hard-coded and close to optimal.
- A player's favorite moves has little to no relationship with their actual efficiency.
- Experimenting consists in trying random moves, and occurs more when the PCs are in trouble.
- Dangerous players always favor strategy and rarely need to experiment.

> Strats :
- The player has few or none of them at start.
-> As time passes, the player gets better and unlocks new strats.
-> If the players stumbles on a strat through experimenting, he will remember it.
- The most efficient strats may come in two flavors for balance : "sometimes" and "always".
* Use spells : Your mages have spells. Use them.
* Actual damage : Avoid using the boss's current element.
* Counter damage : Use the most efficient magic (or items ?) against the boss.
* Counter defense : Raise shields matching the boss's current element.
* Raise dead : If a PC is out, raise him ASAP (duh !).
* Focus sprites : Quickly mop off anything that heals the boss.
* Focus Tomberry : KEEP IT OFF ! MAKE IT GO AWAY !
* Clear status : Promptly remove disables from affected PCs.
* Use items : Learn to use potions, ethers and quills.
* Keep up the heal : Make sure the healer stays healthy and buffed, and use him.
* Protect the weak : If a PC is low on life, have the tank protect them.
* DPS run : If the boss is lowlife enough, give everything to finish him.

> Favs :
- Each action, item and spell has a mostly random favor value.
- Pissed off players mostly enjoy winning, and may even favor strats.
- Players will buy more of their favorite items.
- Players *slowly* learn to love items and spells that worked well for them.
-> Shields and armors are an exception : players will learn to love what they lacked.

> QTEs :
- Each player-QTE has a practice score, which increases each time he faces the QTE.
- The success rate of QTEs improves with practice.
- Above some threshold, the odds of scoring a perfect rise quickly.

You play as a (JRPG-style) boss, and fight against a team of Player Characters.
The goal is to score as many Total Party Kill (or Wipes) as you can, and increase the enemy player's Frustration Counter as high as possible.
Each time to wipe the floor with him, the player will reload the game, prepare himself better, and try again.
-> The player will focus on buying/training abilities that would have let him win the previous fight (counters against attacks you used, etc.).

> Basic attacks :
- Deals good damage against a PC of your choice. Does not leave you vulnerable.
-> Deals elemental damage, with an option to change the current element.
* Basic attack
* Elemental attack (does more damage, unless the PCs have a matching shield buff or stuff)
* Switch current element (makes you vulnerable to oposite element)
+> The PCs will figure out the element thing eventually.

> Spells :
- Can deal massive damage.
* Foo storm : Elemental AoE damage.
* Foo strike : Elemental nuke.
* Vorpal sword : Low-or-null damage with a chance of instakill.
- Can inflict Crowd Control on PCs.
* Crippling strike : Good damage with a chance of physical disable.
* Soul drain : Leeches mana from enemy spellcasters, with a chance of magical disable.
* Mud pit : Slows down all the PCs, making them play less frequently.
* Dispel magic : Removes all buffs from one PC.
- Lets you spawn adds with various abilities (max. 2-5? active summons) :
* Summon sprites (heals you over time, very weak)
* Summon mageling (will cast team buffs and offensive spells, tanks moderately, useful in combos)
* Summon Tomberry (sacrifices your HP, instakill a player unless killed under X turns)
+> Will always work the first time around.
+> Is VERY vulnerable to an element of your choice (the player will eventually figure it out).
-> Spells leave you vulnerable to a counter-attack. (Lower shields to fire, makes you sensitive to oposite element, etc.)
-> You should make sure the PCs cannot retaliate. (Counters in CD, defensive buffs inactive, etc.)

> QTEs :
- Overpowered at start, they become less efficient with each use - as the player learns them.
- Once the player is good enough, he may "Perfect!" them, taking no damage and hurting you instead.
-> Triggered by tier changes ?
- Tradeoff between damage/cooldown?/hardness.

> Tier specials :
- Come up with something (each new phases brings up a new twist in your favor)

> Scan :
- Check the PCs equipment, inventory, HP, mana, and whatnot.
-> After each TPK, the player will come back with :
* MOAR EXP : higher base stats (HP, mana), more powerful spells/combos.
* Better armor/staffs/swords : higher combat stats (damage, resistance).
* Enchanted stuff : elemental damages or resistances, passive, regen, etc.
* Trinkets : elemental immunities (prioritizing what hurt them most before).
* Consumables : frustrated players will eventually get into the fight with 300 potions and half as many phÅ“nix's.
* Improved knowledge of your attacks, strats, QTEs and tier powers, depending on what you deployed previously.
+> Unless you're doing too well or are playing on hardmode, in which case the player will Google the fuck out of you.
